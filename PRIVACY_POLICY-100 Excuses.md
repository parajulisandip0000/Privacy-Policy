# Privacy Policy — 100 Excuses
Effective date: 2026-01-06

This Privacy Policy explains how the **100 Excuses** mobile application (the “App”) handles information.

## Summary
- The App is designed to work offline.
- The App does **not** require account creation.
- The App does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.
- The App stores a small amount of data **locally on your device** (for example, whether you accepted the Terms & Conditions).

## Information We Collect
### Personal information
We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, contacts, photos, precise location, or identifiers for advertising.

### App data stored on your device
The App stores the following information locally on your device:
- **Terms acceptance**: whether you accepted the Terms & Conditions.

This data remains on your device unless you clear the App’s storage or uninstall the App.

### Analytics / crash reporting
The App does not include analytics or crash-reporting SDKs and does not send usage data to the developer.

## Permissions
The App does not request special device permissions for normal operation.

## Clipboard
The App includes a feature to copy selected text to your device clipboard. Clipboard contents may be accessible to other apps depending on your Android version and device settings. The App does not read your clipboard contents and does not transmit clipboard data.

## Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate with third-party services that receive your personal data (for example, advertising networks, analytics providers, or social login).

## Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed at children and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Data Security
Because the App operates offline and does not transmit personal data, there is no server-side storage of your personal information by the developer. You are responsible for the security of your device and who has access to it.

## International Users
The App processes data locally on your device. No personal data is transmitted by the App to the developer.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we may update the effective date above and/or require re-acceptance of Terms in the App.

## Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact the developer through the channel where you obtained the App.
