# ARArrow Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-01-06  
Version: 1

This Privacy Policy explains how the ARArrow application (the “App”) handles information when you use it.

## Summary

- The App does **not** require an account.
- The App stores your profile name and high scores **locally on your device**.
- The App uses your **camera** for gameplay when you enter AR mode.
- Optional offline multiplayer uses **peer‑to‑peer** connections between devices. The App does not provide a central server for gameplay or leaderboards.
- The App is not designed to collect or sell personal data.

## Information We Use

### Camera and Sensor Access (Gameplay)

When you use AR mode, the App requests access to:

- **Camera** (to display the camera background during gameplay).
- **Device motion/orientation sensors** (to aim/align the game based on device orientation, where supported).

The App uses these permissions for gameplay features. The App does not intentionally record your camera feed.

### Local Game Data (Stored on Your Device)

The App stores the following locally on your device (for example, in browser/app storage):

- Display name (if you enter one)
- Local scores / leaderboard entries
- Your acceptance of Terms & Conditions

This data stays on your device unless you choose to share it (for example, screenshots) or unless your device settings back it up.

### Offline Multiplayer (Peer‑to‑Peer)

If you use the “Multiplayer (offline)” feature, the App can establish a **peer‑to‑peer** connection between devices (using WebRTC). During multiplayer, the App may exchange gameplay state such as:

- Display name you entered
- Current score and match state

The connection is made between players directly. The App does not operate a central matchmaking or gameplay server.

## What We Do Not Collect

We do not intentionally collect:

- Contact information (email, phone number)
- Precise location (GPS)
- Payment information
- Photos/videos from your device camera
- Biometric identifiers
- Device contacts

## Data Sharing

We do not sell personal data.

Data may be shared only in the following limited ways:

- **Between players** during offline multiplayer (peer‑to‑peer), based on what you choose to share in the game (for example, your display name and score).
- **Service providers / platform**: Your download and use of the App through Google Play is governed by Google’s policies, and Google may collect data as part of providing the Play Store and Android platform services.

## Data Retention

Local data remains on your device until you remove it. You can remove local data by:

- Using the in‑app “Clear local data” button (profile + local leaderboard), and/or
- Clearing the app’s storage in Android settings, and/or
- Uninstalling the app.

## Security

We aim to minimize data collection. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is for general audiences and is not intended for children under the age where parental consent is required by local law. If a parent/guardian believes a child has provided personal information, they should delete local app data using the steps above.

## International Users

The App is intended to work offline and does not require data to be transmitted to an app-controlled server for gameplay. Peer‑to‑peer multiplayer transmits data between devices directly.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are made, we may present an updated policy in the app and/or update the store listing. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.

## Contact

For questions about this Privacy Policy, contact the app publisher/developer listed on the Google Play store page where you downloaded the App.
