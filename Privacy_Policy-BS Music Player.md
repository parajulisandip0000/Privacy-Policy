# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-01-12

This Privacy Policy explains how **YT to Mp3** (the “App”) handles information when you use it. If you do not agree with this policy, do not use the App.

## Summary
- The App converts media **on your device**.
- The App uses **Firebase Authentication** (including Google Sign-In if you choose it) to sign you in.
- The App may request **Notification** permission (Android 13+) and **Media/Audio Library** access so features work.
- We do **not** sell personal information.

## Information we collect
### Account and authentication data
If you sign in, we process authentication information provided by Firebase Authentication and (optionally) Google Sign-In, which may include:
- Your Firebase user ID (UID)
- Your email address and basic profile information (if provided by your sign-in method)

### Device media access
If you grant library/media permission, the App can query your device’s media database (e.g., titles/artists/durations and identifiers) to show your library inside the App.

### Files you select for conversion
If you pick a downloaded video, the App accesses that file to extract audio **locally**. The App may create output files (e.g., M4A) in app storage.

### Notifications permission status
If you grant notification permission, the App may show playback controls via Android notifications. The App checks whether permission is granted so it can show/hide prompts.

## How we use information
We use information to:
- Sign you in and keep your session active
- Show your library and playlists inside the App (when permission is granted)
- Convert media you select and store the results in app storage
- Provide playback controls, including notifications (when enabled)

## Sharing
We do not sell your personal information. We share information only as necessary to provide the App:
- **Firebase Authentication / Google Sign-In**: authentication is handled through Google/Firebase services according to their terms and policies.

## Storage and retention
- Converted audio files are stored on your device in app storage until you delete them.
- Playlist data may be stored locally on your device (e.g., SharedPreferences).
- Your authentication data is managed by Firebase Authentication; you can sign out at any time.

## Permissions
The App may request:
- **Media/Audio access**: to display your device library and add songs to playlists.
- **Notifications (Android 13+)**: to show playback controls in the notification shade.

You can grant or revoke permissions in Android system settings.

## Children’s privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The “Effective date” above will be updated when changes are made.
